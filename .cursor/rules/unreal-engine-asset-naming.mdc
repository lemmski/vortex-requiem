# Unreal Engine Asset Naming Conventions

This project follows standard Unreal Engine asset naming conventions. Use these prefixes when creating or searching for assets.

| Asset Type | Prefix |
| --- | --- |
| Blueprint Class | `BP_` |
| Widget Blueprint | `WBP_` or `UI_` |
| Material | `M_` |
| Material Instance | `MI_` |
| Material Function | `MF_` |
| Texture | `T_` |
| Static Mesh | `SM_` |
| Skeletal Mesh | `SK_` |
| Animation Blueprint | `ABP_` |
| Animation Sequence | `AS_` |
| Level / Map | `Lvl_` |
| Input Action | `IA_` |
| Input Mapping Context | `IMC_` |
| Sound Cue | `SC_` |
| Sound Wave | `SW_` |
| Niagara System | `NS_` |
| Niagara Emitter | `NE_` |
| Data Table | `DT_` |

When naming textures, it's also common to use a suffix to denote the type of texture, such as:
- `_D`: Diffuse / Base Color
- `_N`: Normal
- `_M`: Metallic
- `_R`: Roughness
- `_A`: Alpha / Opacity
- `_AO`: Ambient Occlusion
- `_E`: Emissive
