# Vortex Requiem Project Overview

Vortex Requiem is a hardcore looter shooter built with Unreal Engine.

## Directory Structure

- **`Source/`**: Contains all C++ source code.
  - `VortexRequiem/`: The main game module. It is further divided into variants like `Variant_Horror` and `Variant_Shooter` which are left from the FPS template the project was created with for reference with small features to help build a fps game.
  - `AlePCGModule/`: A module for Procedural Content Generation.
- **`Content/`**: Contains all game assets, organized by type and feature.
  - `Content/Blueprints/`: Core gameplay logic in Blueprints.
  - `Content/Characters/`: Character models, animations, and materials.
  - `Content/Weapons/`: Weapon assets.
  - `Content/Variant_Horror/` and `Content/Variant_Shooter/`: Assets specific to each game variant.
- **`Config/`**: Contains configuration files (`.ini`).

## Game Logic

Game logic is implemented using a mix of C++ and Blueprints.
- Core systems and performance-critical code are in C++. See [`Source/VortexRequiem`](mdc:Source/VortexRequiem).
- Higher-level logic, UI, and content-related behaviors are often in Blueprints. See [`Content/Blueprints`](mdc:Content/Blueprints).

## Feature Planning

The feature plan can be found in [`Project Chimera feature plan.docx`](mdc:Project%20Chimera%20feature%20plan.docx).
